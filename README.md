Here is the content of the Cartheur Store. It has been openly shared freely over the years and we are changing the website to align with our new product development ambitions, particularly with ESA.

## What you can find in here

There are sales circulars and white papers from a host of products that we offered previously

* Animals adaptive software - for the Nao robot
* Biotech: Neural transceiver and wireless-power skin
* Companions: Early prototypes of [emotional toys](https://emotional.toys)
* Green Energy: The e-bike power station
* i-cybie development that we did as early as 2002, when we were Paradox Technologies
* Intellectual property mentions such as books and patents

In the spirit of keeping code and information free and available to any and everyone, we have created this GitHub repository to continue this ambition.

Enjoy!
